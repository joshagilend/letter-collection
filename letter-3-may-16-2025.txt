hello world

dear ashley,

you're one of my best friends. i'm so proud of you. you fill me up with happiness.

i was scared for a long time. the military police hurt me. the thought of you kept me going.

you're so special to me. don't stop doing the meditation - don't stop doing the yoga - you need it. stay in san francisco.

the team will take care of you. you are a saint. 

i love you so much. you're the best :)

josh
