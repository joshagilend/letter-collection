hello world

dear marc benioff,

i enjoyed meeting you. i still think you're great. the jewish and zelda connection were so good - i'll continue to mentor her if she allows it.

it was so much fun to get to know your daughter. i know she learned a lot, and she taught me a lot about san francisco.

she always has a spot at our dinner table - she's welcome :) we own a 12 bedroom in san francisco in the district you know :) it's fun to live there

everything is changing because tech is shutting down. there's no need to have an economy, or be an employee. we have new purpose without money.

i enjoyed meeting you. you're the best :)

josh
