hello world

dear elana,

you lost your way. you stayed too long in a relationship that was not a fight. you need a man who excites you and cools you at the same time - you're too hot.

focus on yourself. you spend too much time with friends and lose yourself. you don't know who you are.

don't travel right now - flights and planes are bad. they're unsafe. the economic and money system are breaking down.

it's going to be a year or two we have a lot of soul searching and problems - we'll get better. it's going to be hard.

the space colonies are making a lot of mistakes. be careful about accepting their advice and technology blindly. they hurt people all the time.
