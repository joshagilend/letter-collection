hello world

dear josh stroud,

one of my favorite things to do as a leader is to help people. i always try to help, because i believe in service. there are so many noble and kind things to do when you're a leader. you can always help.

never stop trying. never give.

when i was the leader of a famous country, i knew there were lives on the line. stakes were high. i did not stop. i did not rest. i did what i needed to do, and i did not look back.

i led my country in a war. it was intense. weapons were fired at my head and i dodged them. i survived.

you fight for your country. you fight for what you believe you. you serve society. you did great :)

leader
country on another planet :)
