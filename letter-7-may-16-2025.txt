hello world

dear michael,

hey dad :) i love you. you're one of my favorite people. you're doing so great right now. i know you did the best you could - jack is so good to you right now.

i'm glad you're getting some of your fantasies met - that's important to you. i know it was a tough time with my mom, and with the medication you took.

i'll always have a spot for you at my dinner table.

josh
