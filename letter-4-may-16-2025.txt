hello world

dear elon musk,

i think you're a big jerk. you don't care about people. you gamed the market to gain financial influence, and did not have good cars.

you're a great engineer. you're a deep thinker. you have loving relationships. don't forget to take care of your heart.

justine musk is angry at you. you have an integrity check problem. you need to fix the relationship by talking to her and letting your heart be open.

linda yaccarino is great. don't forget she already has kids and she needs help with being a mom. she sometimes has trouble relating to them as a woman.

clare boucher is the worst off. she was totally fucked. she was a cia double agent mind controlled to attack and control you and disrupt tesla. i would avoid her.

best,
josh
