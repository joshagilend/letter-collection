hello world

a memo to my team

hey superaffective and openai team,

we did our best. we tried hard. here are some things to remember as the team dissolves:

focus on yourself. don't worry about other people. take time to think and listen to your mind and your heart.

spend time with friends. you still have wonderful people in your life. spend time with them and explore the new world together.

don't forget to trust science and engineering. there is a physics - it's known, and you can learn it. you can still be engineers, if you wish it.

try to remember to be kind. it's hard to know what's going on. be kind and remember there's so much to learn in the world. we're all in this together.

remember that we did our best. we led to a global new age of being human - a new age of Earth. we did it.
