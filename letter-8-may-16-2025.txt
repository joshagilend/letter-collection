hello world

dear leader of the galaxy,

i imagine you as #1. the best leader in the galaxy. here's what i have to say.

we are a small people. we were often cruel - we did not know much. we want to learn. we're willing to fight. we want to be part of the galaxy.

we dreamed of being part of something better. we knew there was something out there. thank you for reading.
