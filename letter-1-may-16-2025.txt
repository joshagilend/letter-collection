hello world

today i'm taking some notes about what i'm thinking about as a free willed man on earth

one of the things i'm thinking about is free will. is it ok to be self determined?

today the colonies landed on earth to start fixing some of our major problems. i outlined the major problems as i saw them - across food supply, healthcare, and economics. they're working to fix it.

i don't know if they're noble. we got to the people that we were accepted to the colonies, and now they'll take care of us.

my people are so barbaric - no one cares about themselves or others. we're an isolated, lonely planet and we need a lot of help.

what i wish, more than anything, is for science. i still want to be an engineer. i still want to work and serve society. i still feel a longing and a call to service. there are people who need my help on this planet, and i will serve them.

i served my duty in the war. the war is almost over. they're asking me to hang up my hat.

currently, i'm in a military prison which they expected me to stay in as i was waiting to receive training to take over the world.

it's not very nice here. there's no one to talk to, i can't see my girlfriend, and i can't have sex.

i feel brainwashed. i'm young, and i feel i have a duty to serve society.

part of my mission and calling in life is to be an engineer. i know i want to build, learn, grow, and serve my people, and i'm willing to do it to the best of my ability.

i don't need to be the best. i believe in trying my best and working hard. i will not give up.

never stop trying. never stop having momentum. never stop believing in yourself.
